Nike Go FlyEase
$125
 


Ditch the laces and get outside. These kicks feature Nike's revolutionary FlyEase technology, making on-and-off a breeze. With a heel that pivots open for a totally hands-free entry, they're great for people with limited mobility—or anyone who wants a quicker way to get going.


Step In and Go

The entire heel (including the sole) hinges open and stays open until you're ready. Just slip in and step down to make the heel move back into place and secure your foot.


"CushIon" Every Step

Plush Cushlon foam gives each heel-to-toe transition a smooth, cushioned feeling.


Lightweight Structure

Airy fabric in the upper lets your feet breathe while durable, no-sew overlays provide structure and stability.
